OS X has a built in VNC (Screen Sharing) server, but it is a little known feature that it also has a built in VNC client. No additional software is necessary.

To setup the server go to Preferences->Sharing and check the "On" checkbox next to "Screen Sharing". Make sure to only allow access to Administrators or a specific user/user group.

You should see your computer name on the Screen Sharing configuration screen.
To connect to your computer from another one using VNC open Finder and press `âŒ˜+k`. In the Server Address enter `vnc://` followed by your computer name or IP address.
