For years I have wondered if there is a way to change the brightness on my
external Apple LED Cinema Display which is connected via display port to my MacBook
Pro. By default the brightness key on the function row of the keyboard only
changes the brightness of the built-in Retina Display.

If you want to change the display brightness of your external display hold the
Control key while pressing the F1/F2 keys on your keyboard. This will change the
brightness only on the external display.
